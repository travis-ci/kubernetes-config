  # This annotation puts the AWS ELB into "TCP" mode so that it does not
  # do HTTP negotiation for HTTPS connections at the ELB edge.
  # The downside of this is the remote IP address of all connections will
  # appear to be the internal address of the ELB. See docs/proxy-proto.md
  # for information about enabling the PROXY protocol on the ELB to recover
  # the original remote IP address.
